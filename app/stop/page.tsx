            <p>{`All right, all right.  If you know about the money, our firm is really of no benefit to you from a "providing information" stand point.   But hold on.  Is it possible there is other money out there to which you have a claim?  A second source that we may have found?  Regardless, you know about money that belongs to you, but for some reason you have choosen to not yet make a claim.  Whatever the reason, there is one more option available to you.  If you do not want to go through the effort to file a claim, potentially pay attorney fees and wait months and months to recieve your money, IMM Research will offer to buy your claim from you, now.  We will pay you cash upfront for your claim.  No risk to you.  If we lose, you still keep the money.  Please give us a call, we would be delighted to discuss your situation with you.`}</p>
